# Website-1-Russell Stubley Portfolio website

Design:
I chose the design colours of cornsilk and palegoldenrod because I felt the colours gave away my personality but also took into account how professional the 
site is mean't to be. I tried to make it simple and clean which is easy for navigational purposes. It has my professional pictures on that I have used on other sites 
so that I become recognisable. 

Portfolio:
My portfolio has a brief description and a picture with a link to Github.

Please feel free to enjoy my site.
